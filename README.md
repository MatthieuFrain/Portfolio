### Hi, I'm Matthieu. 👋

I am a **Front-End Developer** passionate about **UI/UX and AI optimization**.
I define myself as a pragmatic "hacker": I don't just execute code; I solve problems.

---

#### 🧠 The "Hacker" Mindset
My approach has always been about using technology to improve daily life.
* **Back in high school**, I bypassed my school software's limitations (Pronote) to build a custom app that gave my classmates real-time notifications for grades and absences.
* **Today**, I'm building a personal AI project to solve "choice paralysis" when watching TV.

#### 🤝 Radical Transparency & Tech Stack
I value honesty. While I was originally trained on **Vue.js & Nuxt.js** (at CESI), my recent professional experiences led me to work with other stacks (Full Stack).
I am now fully reconnecting with the **Vue ecosystem**. I specifically built my portfolio with **Vue 3 & Nuxt.js** to get back up to speed and demonstrate that I am operational and ready to deliver quality code on this stack.

**My Toolkit:**

#### ⚡ Augmented by AI
I am an **"augmented developer"**. I leverage AI tools to code faster, allowing me to focus entirely on **architecture, performance, and user experience**. I believe in autonomy and high standards—delivering polished software without needing micromanagement.

#### 🛡️ Resilience
You might notice a gap in my timeline due to a health issue. This period didn't just test me; it forged my fighting spirit. I used this time to sharpen my tech watch and strengthen my autonomy. I am back today with immense motivation and the maturity to manage priorities efficiently.
